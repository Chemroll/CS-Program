# CS-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The final goal of the project is to develop a thermostat that sends data to a company called SysTecâ€™s server software over Wi-Fi, but they first need a working prototype of the low-level thermostat functionality. 

What did you do particularly well?
What I did well was assemblying the various circuit components and isnatlling the software packages 

Where could you improve?
Where I can improve is the area of installing packages and knowing which commands to run

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
the tools I used were the Rasberri Pi, LED lights, LED Screen, circuits boards, electronic components, written instructions and wifi connections

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skill of knowing the kind of packages to install, the kind of commands to run, how to connect the cables and the general fucntionality of the Rasberri Pi

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
From Module 1 to the last Module, the project was built in phases, making it easy to ride along with. Each week had a new component added and tested to confirm its functionality before moving on to the next phase
